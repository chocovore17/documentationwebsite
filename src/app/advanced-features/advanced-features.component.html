                            <p>The advanced features are implemented using the knobs, each knob has a function so a Knobs class is used to ensure the code is well-structured and not repetitive. 
                                A scanKnob function is implemented which reads the altered position of the knob. This function accesses KeyArray therefore requires a semaphore to protect against errors. Each scanKnob call is sandwiched between waiting to receive the semaphore and then giving it up after the task is complete.
                                </p>

                        <p>
                            Using knob3 this feature allows the user to select which octave they wish to play in (The same note shifted one octave up is the same as doubling the frequency of the note). The default octave is 4 (Middle C) and can be changed to be any octave from 0 - 8.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This feature mimics the ‘whammy bar’ found on many electric guitars. By using the Y axis of the Joystick the user can shift the note being played by plus or minus a full tone.

                        <p>
                            Most production keyboards come with (or have a purchasable attachment) a sustain pedal, so to implement this feature we made use of the knobs having push feature so that when the user presses the sustain knob, the current note being played is held until another note it played

                        <p>
                            This feature allows the user to play in whichever key they desire without having to recall the exact notes which exist in that key. By rotating knob 1, key options are cycled through and displayed on the OLED screen. If set to ‘None’ all the notes are assigned as normal, however when set to a certain key, the notes assigned to each key change. For example if the key C minor was selected, the note values would be as in the Figure on the left is in the Cmaj setting and the Figure on the right is the Cmin setting.  The sharp/flat notes are set to not make sounds on this setting.

                            The findNote function will return which key has been pressed and then the correct sound will be indexed from stepSizes depending on the rotation setting of knob1. The limit set on this knob is 14 since there are 14 different keys configured.

                        <p>
                            This feature is implemented using the first knob of the keyboard. Turning the knob ranges from 0-2 and allows the user to select between three different waveforms

                        </ol>  
                        <p>The sawtooth is part of core functionality. The sine wave is implemented using a lookup table and the frequency is managed using the already calculated step sizes and phase accumulator in order to index the table at the correct frequency. The square wave is generated by analogWriting a high (255) and low (0) value depending on the frequency needed which is also decided by the phase accumulator and current step size.
